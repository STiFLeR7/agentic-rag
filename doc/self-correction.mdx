# Automated Self-Correction

Small local models struggle under uncertainty.

Agentic RAG treats self-correction as a **first-class system behavior**
instead of a prompt trick.

## Reflection as a System Node

After each generation step, the system evaluates:

- Retrieval confidence
- Evidence coverage
- Answer completeness

If confidence falls below a threshold, execution halts.

## Query Rewriting

When retrieval fails, the agent rewrites the query:

- Ambiguous language is removed
- Technical identifiers are inferred
- Search intent is sharpened

Example:

- Original: “Why did it fail?”
- Rewritten: “QTP-X configuration failure modes”

## Controlled Retry Loop

The system then:
1. Re-enters retrieval
2. Expands or refines context
3. Regenerates with stronger evidence

Retries are bounded and observable.

## Why This Matters

Failures become recoverable states —
not silent exits.

This transforms the model from a passive generator
into an active reasoning agent.
