# Agentic RAG

**Agentic RAG** is a production-grade reasoning engine designed to achieve **100% recall** on technical domains while running entirely on **consumer hardware**.

Unlike conventional RAG pipelines that fail silently due to dense retrieval collapse, this system uses **explicit control flow, hybrid retrieval, and self-correction** to guarantee correctness under constraint.

This documentation explains:
- Why standard RAG fails quietly
- How hybrid hyper-retrieval restores recall
- How agentic control prevents hallucinations
- How the system is evaluated on real hardware
