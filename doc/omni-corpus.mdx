# Omni-Corpus Retrieval

Traditional RAG pipelines fragment context.

Agentic RAG uses **small-to-big retrieval** to preserve both
precision and narrative completeness.

## The Fragmentation Problem

Standard chunking strategies:
- Retrieve isolated fragments
- Drop surrounding context
- Force the model to infer missing information

This leads to partial answers and subtle hallucinations.

## Parent–Child Chunking Strategy

The corpus is ingested in two layers:

1. **Parent Chunks**
   - Large semantic units (~2000 characters)
   - Preserve full conceptual context

2. **Child Chunks**
   - Smaller searchable units (~400 characters)
   - Optimized for retrieval

Each child chunk stores a reference to its parent.

## Retrieval Flow

1. Search is performed over child chunks
2. Top matches identify relevant parents
3. Full parent context is retrieved for generation

The system retrieves the **needle** but reads the **entire haystack section**.

## Result

- Precise retrieval
- Complete context
- No narrative loss

This is critical for correctness in technical explanations.
