# Introduction

Modern Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often **fail quietly**.

They return fluent, confident answers that appear correct — but are factually wrong.
This is especially dangerous in technical domains, where incorrect answers are hard to detect.

The problem is not the language model.

It is **retrieval collapse**.

## The Silent Failure Problem

Dense vector retrieval optimizes for semantic similarity.
This works well for natural language, but breaks down for:

- Error codes
- Configuration keys
- Function names
- Hex identifiers and symbols

During embedding, these identifiers are **smoothed into generic semantic space**.
When retrieval fails, the LLM is forced to hallucinate.

On constrained hardware, engineers are usually pushed into a false choice:

- Cloud models with strong retrieval but no privacy
- Local models with weak retrieval and silent failure

Agentic RAG rejects this trade-off.

## Design Goal

> **Guarantee recall before generation.**

Agentic RAG is engineered as a controllable reasoning system that runs entirely on
consumer hardware while preserving correctness.

This documentation explains how that guarantee is achieved.
