# Hybrid Hyper-Retrieval

Dense-only retrieval is insufficient for technical domains.

Agentic RAG uses a **two-stage hybrid retrieval pipeline**
designed to maximize recall before optimizing precision.

## Stage 1: Recall Maximization

Two retrievers operate in parallel:

- **BM25 (keyword-based)**  
  Captures exact identifiers, symbols, and rare tokens.

- **Vector Search (ChromaDB)**  
  Captures semantic intent and conceptual similarity.

Their results are merged into a single candidate pool.

This stage answers only one question:

> “What should not be missed?”

## Stage 2: Precision Re-Ranking

High recall introduces noise.
Precision is restored using a **cross-encoder re-ranker**:

- Model: `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`
- Execution: GPU-accelerated
- Scoring: Pairwise relevance

This stage determines what is actually relevant.

## Why This Works

- BM25 prevents identifier loss
- Dense vectors preserve semantic breadth
- Cross-encoders restore ranking accuracy

The result is **100% recall with controlled precision**
on consumer hardware.
