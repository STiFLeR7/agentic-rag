Project Orion: Advanced Quantum Telemetry Protocol (QTP-X)
CONFIDENTIAL SPECIFICATIONS - 2026

1. Core Architecture
   The QTP-X system relies on a 'Hyper-State' entanglement bus running at 4.2 Tera-qubits per second.
   Unlike legacy QTP (v1.0), QTP-X introduces 'Chronos' latency compensation, which reduces packet loss by predicting state collapse 12ms into the future.

2. Hardware Requirements
   - Primary Processor: NeuroCore N-900 (requires liquid nitrogen cooling).
   - Memory: Minimum 128 Pentabytes of Holographic RAM.
   - Power Supply: Zero-Point Energy Module (ZPE-M) Type C.

3. Failure Modes
   - 'Cascade Resonance': Occurs if ZPE-M output fluctuation exceeds 0.003%.
   - Mitigation: Activate 'Aegis' dampeners immediately.

4. Personnel
   - Chief Architect: Dr. Elena Voss.
   - Lead Engineer: Marcus Thorne.
   - Security Level: Crimson clearance required.
