Random Forests\n3.  Elastic Net\n\nThe documentation mentions \"a variety of models\" are used, but only explicitly names these three. I am unable to identify six specific models from the provided context."

    "response": "The previous searches have provided some context for Figure III.3. Based on those results, I can infer the following:\n\nFigure III.3 in the Project Orion Qatar documentation, titled \"Qatar: Machine Learning Process for Qatar,\" likely illustrates the steps involved in using machine learning to create nowcasts for the Qatari economy. It probably depicts a flowchart showing the flow of data, model training, validation, and output. The diagram might highlight specific machine learning techniques used, such as Support Vector Machines. It could also show how economic theories and knowledge are incorporated into the process to ensure balanced sectoral coverage.\n\nI am still unable to provide a more detailed description without being able to directly view the image."
