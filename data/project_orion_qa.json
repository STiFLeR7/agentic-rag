    "question": "What are the key technological advancMs of the QTP-X system's core architecture?",
    "answer": "The QTP-X system's core architecture features a 'Hyper-State' entanglement bus capable of running at 4.2 Tera-qubits per second, representing a significant advancement in quantum computing by enabling faster and more complex quantum entanglements. Additionally, the 'Chronos' latency compensation mechanism is a novel approach to reducing packet loss by predicting state collapse 12ms into the future, which could greatly enhance the reliability and efficiency of quantum communications.",
