    Phase 7: The Omni-Corpus
    
    The concept of specific Parent Document Retrieval is crucial for RAG.
    Here is a specific detail: The key access code for the vault is 998877.
    
    This detail is buried in a long paragraph. If we only retrieved the code '998877',
    we might miss the context that it belongs to 'the vault'.
    
    By retrieving this entire parent block, the LLM knows exactly what the code is for.
    Project Orion also mentioned this technique in section 4.
